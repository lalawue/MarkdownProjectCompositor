<h2>Blab 2</h2>
<p>AMNA NAWAZ: It was another busy weekend for the crowd of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, with many of them flocking to a new and unexpected battleground state.</p>
<p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), Presidential Candidate: There is no middle ground.</p>
<p>AMNA NAWAZ: Fourteen Democratic presidential candidates descended on California this weekend, rallying some of the state's most progressive voters at its Democratic Convention with promises of sweeping change.</p>
<h3>Blab 2.1</h3>
<p>PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), Presidential Candidate: The riskiest thing we could do is try too hard to play it safe.
AMNA NAWAZ: With a primary vote slated three months earlier than past presidential races, California is poised to play its biggest role yet in shaping the 2020 race.</p>

<h2>Blab 3</h2>
<p>AMNA NAWAZ: Home state Senator Kamala Harris enjoyed a warm reception, but not everyone did.</p>
<p>REP. JOHN DELANEY (D-MD), Presidential Candidate: Medicare for all may sound good, but it's actually not good policy, nor is it good politics.</p>
<h3>Blab 3.1</h3>
<p>REP. JOHN DELANEY: I'm telling you.</p>
<p>AMNA NAWAZ: That's former Maryland Congressman John Delaney.</p>
<h2>Blab 4</h2>
<p>JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D), Presidential Candidate: If we want to beat Donald Trump and achieve big progressive goals, socialism is not the answer.</p>
<p>AMNA NAWAZ: And former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, both moderates who pushed back against ideas from their more progressive fellow candidates, like Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren.</p>
<p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), Presidential Candidate: The time for small ideas is over.</p>
<p>AMNA NAWAZ: Warren and other left-of-center candidates warned against Joe Biden's more moderate policies, though none actually named the former vice president, who currently holds a double-digit lead over his Democratic rivals. Meanwhile, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker stood out while addressing gun violence after the Virginia Beach shooting.</p>
<p>SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), Presidential Candidate: It is time for us as a nation not to normalize the violence and the culture of gun violence.</p>
<p>AMNA NAWAZ: But Biden was noticeably absent from the Saturday California event, opting instead to headline an LGBTQ advocacy group dinner in the swing state of Ohio.</p>
<p>JOSEPH BIDEN (D), Presidential Candidate: We are seeing pushback against all the progress we have made toward equality.</p>
<p>SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-NY), Presidential Candidate: We want women to have a seat at the table.</p>
<p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX News: What about men?</p>
<p>SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: They're already there. Do you not know?</p>
<p>AMNA NAWAZ: New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, meanwhile, sparred with Chris Wallace in a FOX News town hall over women's rights and the network's abortion debate coverage.</p>
<p>SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: What happens on FOX News is relevant because they talked about infanticide for 6.5 hours, 6.5 hours, right before President Trump's State of the Union.</p>
<p>AMNA NAWAZ: On the Republican side, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan shot down a much-speculated 2020 run, saying he wouldn't challenge President Trump for the GOP nomination.</p>
