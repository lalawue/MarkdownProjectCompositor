## Blab 3

AMNA NAWAZ: And former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, both moderates who pushed back against ideas from their more progressive fellow candidates, like Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren.

SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), Presidential Candidate: The time for small ideas is over.

AMNA NAWAZ: Warren and other left-of-center candidates warned against Joe Biden's more moderate policies, though none actually named the former vice president, who currently holds a double-digit lead over his Democratic rivals.

AMNA NAWAZ: New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, meanwhile, sparred with Chris Wallace in a FOX News town hall over women's rights and the network's abortion debate coverage.

SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: What happens on FOX News is relevant because they talked about infanticide for 6.5 hours, 6.5 hours, right before President Trump's State of the Union.

AMNA NAWAZ: On the Republican side, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan shot down a much-speculated 2020 run, saying he wouldn't challenge President Trump for the GOP nomination.
