## Blab 2

Here he this instant stood, I stand in his air, — but I'm alone. Now
were even poor Pip here I could endure it, but he's missing. Pip! Pip!
Ding, dong, ding! Who's seen Pip? He must be up here; let's try the
door. What? neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar; and yet there's no opening
it. It must be the spell; he told me to stay here: Aye, and told me this
screwed chair was mine. Here, then, I'll seat me, against the transom,
in the ship's full middle, all her keel and her three masts before me.


### Blab 2.1

Weep so, and I will murder thee! have a care, for Ahab too is mad. Listen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck, and still know that I am there. And now I quit thee. Thy hand! — Met! True art thou, lad, as the circumference to its centre. So: God for ever bless thee; and if it come to that, — God for ever save thee, let what will befall."

#### Blab 2.1.1

I'll have me — let's see — how many in the ship's company, all told? But I've forgotten. Any way, I'll have me thirty separate, Turk's-headed life-lines, each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin. Then, if the hull go down, there'll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin, a sight not seen very often beneath the sun! Come hammer, caulking-iron, pitch-pot, and marling-spike! Let's to it.


## Blab 3

The coffin laid upon two line-tubs, between the vice-bench and the open hatchway; the Carpenter caulking its seams; the string of twisted oakum slowly unwinding from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of his frock. — Ahab comes slowly from the cabin-gangway, and hears Pip following him.

### Blab 3.1

Back lad; I will be with ye again presently. He goes! Not this hand complies with my humor more genially than that boy. — Middle aisle of a church! What's here?"

### Blab 3.2

ife-buoy, sir. Mr. Starbuck's orders. Oh, look, sir! Beware the hatchway!

## Blab 4

Sir? The hatchway? oh! So it does, sir, so it does.

Art not thou the leg-maker? Look, did not this stump come from thy shop?
